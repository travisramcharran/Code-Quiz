# Code-Quiz
A timer based coding assessment using mainly Javascript.

## Description
 A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

 ## Installation
 First I created a repository on Github called Code-Quiz. Then used VSCode to create the index.html, style.css, and script.js files. Then to make it a little easier for myself to create the local storage, I made another html file and another javascript file.

 ## Usage
 I used HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap 5 CDN for this assignment. This web application can be used by students learning to code and help sharpen their knowledge.
